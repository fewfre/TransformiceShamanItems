		- Download button on Toolbox is now bigger (to show importance)
		- ShopInfoBar buttons tweaked
			- Refresh button is now smaller and to the right of download button

		- [bug] If you selected an item + colored it, selected something else, and then selected it again, the infobar image showed the default image.
